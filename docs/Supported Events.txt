Supported events are 

Spawn
spawn a unit at a given point
entity - The type of unit to spawn
x - lon (decimal degrees)
y - lat (decimal degrees)
alt - altitude
location - a series of tags by which to find a site to spawn the entity i.e. Military Airport
specifying an x,y will override any location argument


InitializeState
Places an entity into its first state as determined by its process graph,
instantiates the process tree for the entity

StateChange
Make an entity transition state, updating the speed and properties as needed.

GoTo
Make the entity move to a location

x, y [alt] - specify a set of coords to move the entity towards
location - a series of tags by which to find a site to travel i.e. Military Airport

An entity will continue traveling towards its destination until it arrives or is assigned a new destination.
Entities update their speed and, consequently, their travel time based on the speed allowed for the state

Arrival
Thrown when an entity is no longer in transit - it has arrived at its destination.
In the future, this will throw a message to entity to allow state changes to key off of arrivals

VelocityChange
An internal event that alerts the geometry system to update an entity's time till arrival. 
This event will gain additional relevance when targetting and tracking systems are implemented.
